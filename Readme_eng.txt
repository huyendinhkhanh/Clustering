The program is written using Matlab 2016a.
To use the program, users need to install Matlab software (preferably version 2016a to be compatible with the library functions used).
In the Code directory there are three sub directories, BOOLE, DC and FCM, which correspond to three algorithms: clustering algorithm based on Boole matrix,
clustering algorithm based on orthogonal neutrosophic matrices and fuzzy c-means clustering. To run the program for each algorithm, do the following:
1. Open Matlab, click Open, select the DiagnosisSystem.m file in the respective directory of each algorithm above.
2. Click Run to run the program, the interface will appear with the functions for the user to choose (to read instructions, click on "?" button on
screen).
3. The result is displayed on the screen and saved in the folder: C: \ TEST_150517
